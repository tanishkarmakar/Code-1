//Code Assignment Week 1- Tanish Karmakar

//For this assignment I wanted to create an interactively generated visualization based on a phlisophical reasoning or theory.
//Based on "Morton's Fork", which "is a specious piece of reasoning in which contradictory arguments lead to the same conclusion."
//To highlight this, moving the mouse over the screen causes a variable streak of red and blue circles overlapped on each other to travel in one direction, regardless of the movement of the mouse.
//This is meant to evoke the feeling that regardless of all the efforts made to change it, nature essentially runs its course. That we cannot change but accept what has happened and will happen.


//As a result of jsut watching some tutorials and playing around with code, I do not expect this piece to be a polished product.

void setup() {
size(1920,1080);
background(0);

}


void draw() {

//After a lot of experimentation, I realised that I have to tweak and add some values to mouseX and mouseY to cause an evergoing streak of red and blue. 

mouseX = mouseX + 5;
mouseY = mouseY + 10;
stroke (242,223,0);
strokeWeight (10);
fill (255,random(223),0);
ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,100,100);

//I have played around with strokeWeight and fill to get the desired visual qualities. Furhermore, I have tweaked the x and y positions of the ellipses to get them into the desired position after a lots of trial and error.


stroke (255,0,0);
fill(0,0,random(255));
ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,200,200);

stroke (0,0,255);
strokeWeight (10);
fill(255,0,0);
ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,100,100);

stroke (0,0,255);
strokeWeight (10);
fill(0,0,255);
ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,100,100);


}

//Thank you for viewing my code. Hope you like it!
